# Tkinter-GUI-App-using-MongoDB

This project is inspired from @Mariya but she built this app using sqlite3 database, so i decided to convert the app from sqlite3 to mongodb and i succeed on that, so you can see that migrate_data_sqlite3_to_mongodb.py file i used to change my sqlite3 data to mongodb, and my workout file for fetching and processing data, if any doubt regarding this repo feel free to contact.
